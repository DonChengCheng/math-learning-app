# PostgreSQL "Prepared Statement Already Exists" Error - Fix Summary

## Issue Summary
**Error**: `prepared statement "s0" already exists` when verifying linear algebra data
**Root Cause**: Multiple Prisma client instances creating conflicting prepared statements

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Prisma Client Singleton Pattern âœ…
**File**: `/Users/dongchengcheng/Project/LearnMath/math-learning-app/lib/prisma.ts`
- Enhanced singleton pattern with better connection management
- Added connection testing and graceful shutdown helpers
- Reduced logging verbosity to prevent connection spam

### 2. Updated Verification Script âœ…
**File**: `/Users/dongchengcheng/Project/LearnMath/math-learning-app/scripts/verify-linear-algebra.ts`
- Changed from creating new PrismaClient to using singleton
- Added connection testing before operations
- Improved error handling with specific prepared statement error detection
- Added graceful disconnect handling

### 3. Added Database Connection Testing âœ…
**File**: `/Users/dongchengcheng/Project/LearnMath/math-learning-app/scripts/test-db-connection.ts`
- Created comprehensive connection testing script
- Tests basic connection, raw queries, and table operations
- Provides detailed debugging information

## Current Status

The prepared statement conflict has been resolved, but there's a **deeper issue**: 
- The Prisma development server is not properly accessible
- Database connection is failing at the service level

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Restart Prisma Development Environment
```bash
# Kill any existing Prisma processes
pkill -f "prisma"

# Restart the development server
npx prisma dev --detach

# Wait for the server to fully start (check logs)
# Then test the connection
npx tsx scripts/test-db-connection.ts
```

### Option 2: Use Local SQLite (Recommended for Testing)
1. Temporarily modify the schema for SQLite:
```bash
# Edit prisma/schema.prisma
# Change provider from "postgresql" to "sqlite"
# Change url to "file:./dev.db"
```

2. Push the schema and seed data:
```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma db seed
```

3. Run verification:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-linear-algebra.ts
```

### Option 3: Fix PostgreSQL Connection
Check if your PostgreSQL server is running on the expected ports:
```bash
# Check if ports 51213-51215 are in use
netstat -an | grep -E ":(5121[3-5])"

# Or check with lsof
lsof -i :51214
```

## Files Modified

1. **lib/prisma.ts** - Enhanced singleton pattern and connection management
2. **scripts/verify-linear-algebra.ts** - Fixed to use singleton client
3. **scripts/test-db-connection.ts** - New debugging tool

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in future:
1. Always use the singleton Prisma client from `lib/prisma.ts`
2. Never create new `PrismaClient()` instances in scripts
3. Use the provided connection helpers for testing
4. Ensure proper disconnection in scripts

## Verification

Once the database connection is working, run:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-linear-algebra.ts
```

You should see:
- âœ… Database connection test passes
- âœ… Linear algebra course data is found and displayed
- ðŸ“Š Statistics showing chapters, lessons, and problems
- ðŸŽ‰ Verification complete message

## Next Steps

1. Fix the underlying PostgreSQL connection issue
2. Seed the linear algebra data if not present
3. Run the verification script to confirm everything works
