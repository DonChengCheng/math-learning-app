# Connection Bug Analysis

## Bug Description
- **Error**: "This site can't be reached" when accessing localhost:3001/dashboard
- **Error Code**: ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
- **Location**: Browser trying to access localhost:3001/dashboard
- **Status**: localhost refused to connect

## Root Cause Analysis
The development server appears to not be running on port 3001, or there's a port mismatch between:
1. Where the development server is actually running
2. Where the browser/application is trying to connect
3. Environment configuration inconsistencies

## Potential Causes
1. Development server not running
2. Server running on different port (likely 3000 instead of 3001)
3. Environment variable mismatch (NEXTAUTH_URL pointing to wrong port)
4. Process conflict or server crash

## Investigation Results
✅ Development server IS running on port 3000 (confirmed via lsof and ps)
❌ Environment variables configured for port 3001
❌ NEXTAUTH_URL pointing to wrong port causing auth redirects to fail

## Root Cause Identified
Port mismatch between:
- Server running on: localhost:3000
- NEXTAUTH_URL configured for: localhost:3001
- Browser trying to access: localhost:3001/dashboard

## Fix Plan
1. Update NEXTAUTH_URL in both .env and .env.local to point to port 3000
2. Restart development server to apply new environment variables
3. Test dashboard access
4. Verify authentication flow works correctly

## Files to Modify
- `.env` - Update NEXTAUTH_URL from port 3001 to 3000
- `.env.local` - Update NEXTAUTH_URL from port 3001 to 3000

## Fix Status: COMPLETED ✅

### Verification Results
- ✅ Updated NEXTAUTH_URL in both environment files
- ✅ Restarted development server successfully  
- ✅ Homepage accessible at localhost:3000 (HTTP 200)
- ✅ Dashboard properly redirects for authentication (HTTP 302)
- ✅ Server logs show successful routing and compilation
- ✅ Linting passes with no new issues

### Testing
- Homepage: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000` → 200 ✅
- Dashboard: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000/dashboard` → 302 ✅ (proper auth redirect)

The connection issue has been resolved. Users can now access localhost:3000/dashboard and will be properly redirected through the authentication flow.
